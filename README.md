this is my first try at creating a chrom extenstion, it folled a tutorial
i did while learning javascript.

it just saves input txt to localStorage on the users machine, it also grabs the current tab
url and will store the url to the same array, you can clear the localStorage if needed

it may be useful for someone to quick save information but i just built it as a test and gained
the ability to create other chrome extenstions if i find a idea.
